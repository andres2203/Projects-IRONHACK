# Goal:
Show water shortage and temperature changes on countries affected by climate change


## Environmental Data an Sources:
1. [Temperature](http://apps.ipcc-data.org/observ/clim/cru_ts2_1.html)
2. [Precipitation and water ressources](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators#)

## Socio-Economical Data and Sources:
1. [Countries of the world](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world)

# Visuals
1. Renewable freshwater ressources worldwide
Distribution of water supplies for freshwater (drinkingwater) worldwide. 

    Filter: calulated field

2. Temperature and pupulation distribution
Overview of Countries, Temperatures and Popullation

3. Countries with high water consuption
Precipitation and Water withdraw plot.

    Filter: Region

4. Temperature and GDP distribution
Correlation between Regions, Temperature-gradients and GDP

    Filter: Region

5. Countries with low GDP
Graph shows the temperature gradient at low income countries. 

    Filter: GDP, Precipitation, Region
